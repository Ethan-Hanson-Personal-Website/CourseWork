1:in the assignment the direction of Refactor the Starting Point

    Delete the prebuilt counter example as follows: delete all the JSX code except for one parent div element.
        Remember that all JSX code must be returned within one parent element or fragment.
    Delete the line that include the useState hook.
    Delete all the unused import statements.
    Save the application, and then go to your browser. Notice the empty page, and then congratulate yourself.
" does not appear to say which jsx to delete. After reviewing the two I think its refering to app (confused since the last instruction refered me to main) since it is the jsx that has divs.

2:same instructions as above but wondering how much total code to delete so changed "import { useState } from 'react'
import reactLogo from './assets/react.svg'
import viteLogo from '/vite.svg'
import './App.css'

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  return (
    <>
      <div>
        <a href="https://vitejs.dev" target="_blank">
          <img src={viteLogo} className="logo" alt="Vite logo" />
        </a>
        <a href="https://react.dev" target="_blank">
          <img src={reactLogo} className="logo react" alt="React logo" />
        </a>
      </div>
      <h1>Vite + React</h1>
      <div className="card">
        <button onClick={() => setCount((count) => count + 1)}>
          count is {count}
        </button>
        <p>
          Edit <code>src/App.jsx</code> and save to test HMR
        </p>
      </div>
      <p className="read-the-docs">
        Click on the Vite and React logos to learn more
      </p>
    </>
  )
}

export default App" 
.....................................................
into
.....................................................
"import './App.css'

function App() {

  return (
    <>
      <div>
       
      </div>
    </>
  )
}

export default App"

Am hoping that this was correct (*it was)
